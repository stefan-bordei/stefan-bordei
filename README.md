I started to gain more and more interest in Computer Science after working as a Tattoo Artist and using 2D/3D software in order to create concepts/designs for my clients and discovering scripting for Blender3D. After starting the CS course in UCD I fell in love with Linux and coding and I feel the burning need to tell every person I meet that I use NixOS as my main operating system at Home.

I am fascinated with how vast this domain is and am constantly looking to grow and to learn more.
